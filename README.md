# Pong
Game Pong with Python3

## I - What do you need ?
You need an interface that can run a Python file like Visual or Spyder or PyCharm.

You need to install the turtle package otherwise the program will not run properly.

> sudo pacman -S tk

## II - How to run the game ?

If you are on Linux, you only need terminal & use the command `python3 [name file]`.

## III - How to play ?

Only 4 keys to know, two to the left of the keyboard to move the left paddle ('a' to up & 'q' to down) and two to the right of the keyboard to move the right paddle ('key up' & 'key down').
